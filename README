=====================================================================

Ratchet is licensed under the GNU GPL v2.

How to run:

Ratchet needs to be run as root, to that end, the mempodroid root exploit
is also included in the download.

Push ratchet onto /data/local/.

If not rooted (from ADB shell): ./mempodroid 0xd9ec 0xaf47 /data/local/ratchet

If your device is rooted, make sure to 'su' before you run ratchet.
